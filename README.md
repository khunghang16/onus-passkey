# Authsignal React Native Passkeys Example

This example shows how to integrate [Authsignal](https://www.authsignal.com/) with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) to use passkeys.

The example app uses a mock DB to store user records.
You can find an alternative version which integrates with AWS Cognito [here](https://github.com/authsignal/react-native-passkey-example/tree/with-aws-cognito).
